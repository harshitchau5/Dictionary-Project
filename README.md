# Dictionary-Project
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: My project takes the input of a user starting with asking for language with choices being Hindi and french. After that has been entered, it will give you 5 total choices with the 5th one being QUIT to exit the program. The following are the lines with their explanation:

1. Translate a word - Take the word the user entered and translates it in the selected language
2. Add new word - Adds a new word with its meaning to the list, if the word is already there, it will print "Word already exists" to avoid duplications.
3. List all words - Shows all the words that are already saved
4. Change language - Switch languages from hindi to french and vice versa
5. Quit - Exit the program
